This program answers whether a number is prime or not. It is possible to enter the number via the command line or just call the program and wait for it to request it. If the number is composite, it is possible to factor it into prime numbers.

A file generated by the 'listofprimes' program is required with at least the first 3 prime numbers. The default file name to use is 'list_of_primes'. The lowest value accepted by the program for testing is MINVALUE, which by default is the number 7; the maximum value is ULON_MAX - 1, which may vary from machine to machine. If the user enters a value outside these limits, he will receive a message informing him of the problem and the program will not execute.

If everything works correctly, the program will check whether the prime numbers present in the file are sufficient to reach a conclusion. If they are sufficient, the answer will be provided. Otherwise, the user will be informed of the need to complete the list of prime numbers and the quantity of numbers that will possibly need to be tested to do so. The program will offer the option to continue with the calculation or terminate the execution. If the user decides to proceed, the program will calculate the missing prime numbers to reach a conclusion, provide the final answer and update the prime number file with the values calculated during execution.

If the number is composite, the program will offer the option of factoring it into prime numbers. If the user chooses to perform the factorization, information regarding the prime factors and their powers will be saved in a file and its directory address will be informed to the user. If there is a problem with factoring, the program will display an error message informing what happened.

BE CAREFUL with the value entered to the program, as if it is too high it could take a considerable amount of time to complete the task.
